# Theater Fundraising Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The fundraising goal for the play "Fever" has nearly been met. The purpose of this analysis is to see how similar fundraising campaigns faired based on the amounts of the fundraising goals, and also based on the launch dates of the campaigns. Only data from similar campaigns will be considered.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

When looking at campaign outcomes based on launch date, the month with the greatest number of successful campaigns was May with 111. The next best month for the number of successful campaigns was June with 100. May and June also had the greatest number of campaign launches with 166 and 153 respectively. The number of failed campaigns remained relatively stable throughout each month, only fluctuating from 31 on the low end to 50 on the high end.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

When looking at campaign outcomes based on goal amounts, campaigns with goals lower than 19,999 dollars and campaigns ranging from 35,000 to 44,999 dollars had success rates of 50% or greater. Campaigns for less than 1,000 dollars and campaigns ranging from 1,000 to 4,999 dollars had the greatest success rates at 76% and 73% respectively. Although campaigns ranging from 35,000 to 44,999 dollars had the next highest success rate at 67%, the success rate may not be applicable to further campaigns since there are only 9 in this range.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The primary challenge in this analysis was only including data for Kickstarter campaigns that were similar to the campaign for "Fever". The data initially included campaigns unrelated to theater productions, as well as data for theater construction projects. In order to improve the relevance of this analysis the initial data was filtered to only include information on relevant campaigns.

## Results

### Outcomes Based on Launch Date

When looking at outcomes based on launch date, we can conclude that May and June will have the greatest number of similar campaigns running concurrently. So, when planning the campaign we should assume we will face more competition for donations from other campaigns in those months. In spite of that, we can also conclude that the best months to launch a campaign are May and June due to the number of successful campaigns in those months.

### Outcomes based on Goals

When looking at outcomes based on fundraising goals, we can conclude that it is best to set the campaign goal to an amount of 4,999 dollars or less. Campaigns with goals in that range have the greatest rate of success at about three out of four.

### Dataset Limitations

One limitation of this dataset as it relates to the play "Fever", is that there is no information on how the campaigns were conducted. For the purposes of making sure a campaign is successful it would be useful to know what marketing tactics each campaign relied on.

### Possible Future Analysis

Other tables or graphs that might prove useful would include a table showing the average donation amounts and number of donors for successful and failed campaigned. It would be good to know if it is more productive to target a small number of larger donors, or a greater number of smaller donors.
